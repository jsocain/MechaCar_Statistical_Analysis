## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Summary](images/summary.png)

- Vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
- The slope of the linear model is NOT considered to be zero, because the p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35 x 10-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.
- This linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively, because the r-squared value is 0.71 and the p-value is significant.
